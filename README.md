# little-women-book

This project visualizes the number of times characters from Little Women are mentioned across different chapters. The dataset contains mentions for the characters Amy, Jo, Beth, Meg, and Laurie across ten chapters. In addition, main question is "Do the character who was once in love with one character end up marrying another?". We will find the answer in the project.
